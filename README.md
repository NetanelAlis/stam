# MTA Coin on Containers

## Objective
This project focuses on practicing Inter-Process Communication (IPC) in a container-based development environment. The system includes a server and multiple miner containers, which communicate through named pipes, to simulate a blockchain mining process.

## Overview
The application includes two Docker containers:
1. **Server Container:** Manages miner subscriptions and validates new blocks.
2. **Miner Containers:** Subscribe to the server, receive the current block, mine, and send new blocks to the server.

### Key Features:
- The server manages subscriptions and block validation.
- Miners use named pipes to communicate with the server.
- Configuration file for server difficulty is generated automatically by the script.
- The system supports dynamic scaling of miners based on input parameters.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure the following tools are installed:
- Docker
- Bash shell
- Sudo privileges

### Running the Application
To launch the system, follow these steps:

1. **Make the launcher script executable:**
   ```bash
   chmod +x launcher.sh

2. **Run the launcher.sh script with two parameters**:

    difficulty level (e.g., 5)
    number of miners (e.g., 3)
   
Example command:

./launcher.sh 5 3

MTA Coin on Containers
Objective

This project focuses on practicing Inter-Process Communication (IPC) using container-based development. The goal is to run the server and miners in separate Docker containers, where they communicate via named pipes.
Overview

This system involves two types of containers:

    Server Container: Manages miner subscriptions and validates newly mined blocks.
    Miner Containers: Subscribes to the server, receives the current block, mines new blocks, and sends them back to the server for validation.

Key Features

    The server manages miner subscriptions and validates new blocks.
    The miners communicate with the server via named pipes.
    A configuration file is generated by the script for the serverâ€™s difficulty level.
    The system supports dynamic scaling of miners based on user input.

How to Launch the System

To launch the system, run the launcher.sh script with two parameters:

    Difficulty level: The difficulty for mining.
    Number of miner containers: The number of miners to be launched.

Running the Script

    Make the script executable:

    bash

chmod +x launcher.sh

Run the script with the difficulty level and number of miners:

bash

    ./launcher.sh <difficulty_level> <number_of_miners>

Example:

If you want to run the system with a difficulty level of 5 and 3 miners, the command would be:

bash

./launcher.sh 5 3

**Script Behavior**

   - The script will pull the Docker images from Docker Hub. Ensure you're logged into Docker Hub before running the script.
   - The script requires sudo permissions to run Docker commands.
   - A mounted directory (mnt/mta/) will be created in the current working directory to store pipes and the configuration file.
   - The configuration file (mtacoin.conf) is generated automatically and contains the difficulty level and the miner IDs.
   - The script removes old named pipes and updates the configuration file with new parameters each time it runs.
